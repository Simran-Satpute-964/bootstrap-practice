<h6>Use of Containers</h6>

<!-- Containers provide a means to center and horizontally pad your siteâ€™s contents.
  Use .container for a responsive pixel width or .container-fluid for width: 100% across all viewport and device sizes.
  Utilize breakpoint-specific column classes for easy column sizing without an explicit numbered class like .col-sm-6. -->

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">1 of 2</div>
    <div class="col">2 of 2</div>
